UH-Universe Usability Evaluation Design


User goals:
Connect to other students
Easy access to information about classes and professors
Easy access to clubs and other social groups


Scenarios:

1. You are a new student at UH and you want to connect with people in your class to form study groups, make friends, etc. You can use the app to see who is in your class with similar interests or the same major. Connecting with these people can make the transition to UH a lot more smooth.

2. You are a student at UH and you have no idea what a certain class is like. Maybe you have trouble learning in certain environments (ie: lecture based, group work, etc.). There is only so much an advisor can tell you about a class, so you use the app to get into contact with students that have taken the class, or the professors of the class to get an inside perspective on the workload or teaching style.

3. You are a student at UH that is looking to join an extracurricular club or group. Especially for smaller groups or clubs it may be difficult to get the word out about it. The app provides an easy way for you to learn about clubs and social groups on campus and an easy way for people to promote their clubs/social groups


User types:
University of Hawaii students


Recruitment:
Ask friends/teammates that attend the University of Hawaii to test out my app. Should be able to find at least 10 people to evaluate the app through that avenue.
